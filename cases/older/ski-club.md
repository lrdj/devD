When Andrew bought their domain for them in 1986, the Ski Club's plan was to use the web as a hub to connect the ski reps at European resorts to a data hub hosted in Telehouse in London[^1]

Dug designed the award-winning Ski Club site for four years with Offworld implementing a live feed of snow condition data to BBC Teletext.

Offworld Industries[^2] was approached and asked for trackable banner space on the site. IMB UK created a custom integration for this service. Dug designed white-label templates for the Vauxhall SkiNet microsite. The system used a design system established by Dug as part of the Ski Club of Great Britain's European information-distribution system.

[^1]: From there, the system he built would push reports of snow condition to BBC Teletext. This is cool because XML got started in 1996, and didn't spawn popular data transfer methods until the early 2000s when JSON first reach a specification and ten years before all of that Andrew built and hosted this service used by thousands of UK skiers. That's the sort of magic that got me hooked on digital:-)
[^2]: Offworld Industries was a digital agency created by two friends who had been authoring AI software for financial services customers in the City, and who spotted a need for internet consulting.
