Calling out to my insightful friends leading / building complex cross-functional product and design teams at enterprise scale (as opposed to from scratch in a start-up environment) - when you take over an existing team / group, or go through a merger / acquisition with a larger parent company and have to integrate, what are the most urgent / essential People-ops and employee experience pieces you typically have to do yourself, boot strapping solutions for yourself / your team (when centralised People / HR teams are not not able to help)? Which 2-3 of the below are the most painful or time consuming, that you wish could be done for you?

A - Recruitment ops / managing pipeline / filtering candidates 
B - Team planning + design (ratios, roles, competencies)
C - Compensation strategy (benchmarking, calibrating, ethics)
D - Career paths and levels, progression, development
E - People data / metrics / insights / analysis
F - Onboarding and productivity ramp up
G - Custom people tools / platform / software (which ones / for what?)
H - Collaboration + alignment (OKRs, ownership, cross-functional etiquette)

These include: Registration for alerts will avoid call-centre interactions; Reduced data errors will avoid triggering notification letters and ensuing support calls. The red-and-green bar at the bottom is the "lens" that shows data accuracy over time.

  I led teams through a sequence of strategy and design thinking workshops. I brought teams together to co-design their possible futures and working in partnership with policy and delivery stakeholders, I produced documented recommendations.

  <p>
  The HMRC "Personal Tax Account" was suffering from a number of existential challenges. Owners and service managers could not identify exactly what problems the service was designed and built to solve, nor could they pinpoint any specific needs it addressed.</p>
  <p>
  Over time, it had become a 'portalised' hold-all for elements of tax code communications; PAYE; and pensions information display. This lack of a clear purpose led the leadership team to kick off a phase of visioning work and I was contracted as an external advisor to lead this exploration and produce recommendations.</p>

<!-- content variable starts with "After" -->

In order to bring together a large and complex network of stakeholders, I created design tools and led teams through a sequence of strategy and design thinking workshops: assumptions mapping; problem space assessment; purpose definition; challenge mapping; and vision canvas[^1]. These workshops resulted in greater clarity and a much simpler purpose statement centred on reducing costs while building citizen trust.

With the vision successfully in place, I expressed the as-is/to-be gaps in a series of service blueprints and wrote the next phase briefing with technical architects, business and delivery teams.




[^1]: I designed the Vision Canvas ([review longer article](https://goodlookslikethis.com/vision-canvas-workshops.html)) as an extension to the standard business model canvas (https://www.strategyzer.com/canvas/business-model-canvas) taking into account the different range of pressures and influences a service experiences in public sector. The canvas introduces a #oneTeamGov approach, planning for inclusion of policy constraints and identifying opportunities to share findings to help other organisations acting in the same ecosystem.
