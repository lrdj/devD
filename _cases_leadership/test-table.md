title: "Building a global design team from scratch"
bodyclass: "casesLeadership"

caseOrgName: Accenture (Avanade)

caseType: >
  Big 4 tech consulting firm. 
  - Immature design business when I joined.
  - Built UK arm of global design organisation

caseAction: >
  What did I do?
  - Advocate for design. Over, and over, and over, until I was blue in the face
  - Collaborate with my Global and European team-mates (we were building a new capability so made the most of our mix of backgrounds and skills)
  - Create a dome of protection where my people could thrive and product great work. Accenture is a hyper-accountability environment. There was quite a lot of negotiating required to bring design thinking successfully into the company culture.
  - Organised the coming together of the digital strategy (Sitecore business unit) and XD teams into a larger, cross-functional department

caseImpact: >
  What impact did my team have?
  - Bring about change of attitude in internal marketplace. The lead to customers coming to us instead of going out to agencies and our billings revenue to increase
  - Evidenced quality and delivery, which in turn allowed UK leadership to win further budget for growth
  - Built on their strengths as thought leaders in enterprise technology to claim thought leadership in workplace transformation
  - Competed successfully 
  - Helped me bring in my chargeability targets and the right employee survey results (it was adventure and I think most of the team was happy to be there)

situation: >
  Stakeholders were finding it hard to develop a roadmap for a gov.uk service as there was no foundational vision in place.
task: >
  I was contracted as an external advisor to lead a discovery and produce recommendations.

  <p>
  The HMRC "Personal Tax Account" was suffering from a number of existential challenges. Owners and service managers could not identify exactly what problems the service was designed and built to solve, nor could they pinpoint any specific needs it addressed.</p>
  <p>
  Over time, it had become a 'portalised' hold-all for elements of tax code communications; PAYE; and pensions information display. This lack of a clear purpose led the leadership team to kick off a phase of visioning work and I was contracted as an external advisor to lead this exploration and produce recommendations.</p>

<!-- content variable starts with "After" -->

In order to bring together a large and complex network of stakeholders, I created design tools and led teams through a sequence of strategy and design thinking workshops: assumptions mapping; problem space assessment; purpose definition; challenge mapping; and vision canvas[^1]. These workshops resulted in greater clarity and a much simpler purpose statement centred on reducing costs while building citizen trust.

With the vision successfully in place, I expressed the as-is/to-be gaps in a series of service blueprints and wrote the next phase briefing with technical architects, business and delivery teams.




[^1]: I designed the Vision Canvas ([review longer article](https://goodlookslikethis.com/vision-canvas-workshops.html)) as an extension to the standard business model canvas (https://www.strategyzer.com/canvas/business-model-canvas) taking into account the different range of pressures and influences a service experiences in public sector. The canvas introduces a #oneTeamGov approach, planning for inclusion of policy constraints and identifying opportunities to share findings to help other organisations acting in the same ecosystem.
