### Executive summary

Hello there! We've got a story from sunny Barcelona, where a rising SaaS star, nose-deep in scaling and funds-chasing, found itself at a crossroads. The founding folks stepped sideways, welcoming a seasoned CEO to the helm, eyes set firmly on a hefty growth spurt and dreams of that elusive IPO.

### New kids on the block

As new leadership took the reins, fresh faces filled the C-suite and VP spots, aiming high for that third round of funding and onward to becoming a fully-fledged heavyweight in the market. But here's the snag - while the charm of the original product lingered, our newly hired product organisation was striking a few sour notes.

### Cracks in the wall: Product org woes

This brand-new, sparkly product team, while talented, found themselves a bit adrift in the organizational seas. Communication was a smidgen off, team alignment was akin to herding cats, and let’s just say that the clear delivery of outputs was more a dream than a reality.

### Designing the solution: User experience strategy

Our task? Weave a user experience strategy that could help these creative minds come together and let their user-centred design skills shine bright, driving the performance uplift that the business was itching for.

1. **Solid foundations**: Nurturing an environment where creativity and emotional safety are steadfast.
   
2. **Spotting the issues**: Diving deep to understand their challenges and what’s sparking them.

3. **Crafting principles**: Using those challenges to mould a set of solid product principles and gauge how they stack up against the company values.

4. **Formulating purpose**: Guiding the team through a purpose-creating exercise, joining the dots between their unique stance ("why us") and their main challenge ("what's the hiccup in our world").

5. **Mapping out the needs**: Identifying who needs what and keeping track of the inflow and outflow of resources between connections.

6. **Paving the new road**: With a clear picture of the ‘how’ and ‘why’, we worked alongside the team to lay out a blueprint of their renewed service, detailing what’s needed to pull their improved offering together.

### Hitting the right note: Results

And would you look at that? The results spoke volumes. The VP of Customer Experience choreographed a change programme that tuned up the product organisation. Teams found their rhythm, and the positive results are reverberating through the company's outputs today.

### Wrapping it up

In the end, our journey with the SaaS scale-up in Barcelona was a vibrant tune of transformation, where design and strategy played a crucial role in bridging gaps, aligning teams, and ensuring the original magic of the product didn’t get lost amid the scaling and changes. It’s proof in the pudding that with a bit of careful design thinking and strategy, scaling need not be a messy affair.
