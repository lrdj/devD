### Executive summary 

Embarking on a transformation journey, our Barcelona-based client, a SaaS scale-up, approached a pivotal moment in their development trajectory as they worked towards a Series C funding round. With the founders navigating into chairman and R&D roles, the onboarding of a seasoned CEO signalled a decisive shift towards a growth-centric strategy, robustly aiming at enhancing Annual Recurring Revenue (ARR) and orchestrating a compelling path toward an eventual IPO.

### A new leadership, new vision 

The fresh leadership cadre, bolstered by a reconfigured C-suite and various VPs, engaged in constructing a meticulously curated ‘major-player' company, intended to not only charm the third funding round but also lay a fertile ground for a future public offering. In this metamorphosis, the appointment of a Chief Product Officer (CPO) was pivotal, under whom a robust team was assembled with a mission to elevate the product into its next evolutionary phase.

### Identifying the bottleneck: Dissonance in the product organization 

Despite an air of invigorated leadership and newly-minted talent in the product division, suboptimal functionality permeated the organization. Notably:

- **Inconsistent vision** A distinct disparity between the original product philosophy and the perspectives of the new team.
- **Collaboration roadblocks** The new product talent struggled with synergizing and fabricating a coherent organizational interplay.
- **Operational misalignment** Variances in expectations and execution methods among the new and existing teams impeded seamless operations.

This organizational dissonance signaled a potential misalignment between the palpable vitality of the original culture and the nascent, yet disjointed, product organization.

### Orchestrating harmonization through a user experience strategy 

Entrusted with the responsibility of coalescing the product teams, a systematic User Experience (UX) strategy was conceived and implemented:

1. **Establishing creative foundations** Instilling an environment of emotional safety and nurturing innovative potential.
   
2. **Problem recognition** Delving into the challenges faced by each team, unravelling their origins, and establishing causality.

3. **Principles formulation** Drafting product principles reflecting organizational values, utilizing problem space analysis as a catalyst.

4. **Purpose synthesis** Employing a “Purpose Butterfly” exercise to craft a purpose statement, bridging the team’s unique potential with prevailing challenges.

5. **Needs and output mapping** Charting the customers of the business unit, their requisites, and ensuring the logical flow of inputs and outputs amongst them.

6. **Blueprinting the renewed service** Equipping the team to curate an enhanced service description, encompassing needs, actions, capabilities, technology utilization, data organization, and infrastructure deployment.

### Successful changes lead to notable improvements

The strategy we put into place caused clear, positive changes within our product organization. Led by the VP of Customer Experience, the change program reorganized our teams and led to real, noticeable improvements in our current operations. Moving from a place of misalignment to one of coherence didn't only validate our user experience (UX) strategy but also marked an important step in our client's path towards growth, securing funding, and potentially going public in the future.


#### Closing thoughts

The story of our client's company changing and growing is a powerful example of why it's so important to make sure leadership, company culture, and day-to-day operations are all working towards the same growth goals. By carefully planning their strategies and making thoughtful changes, they managed not only to keep the great aspects of their original product but also to combine them effectively with the strengths and insights of their new leadership and team.
