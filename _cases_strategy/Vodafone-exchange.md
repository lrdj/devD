![UI for Agora European edition](/i/agora_UI.jpg)

Dug did the ethnography, concept development, service design and prototyping in partnership with Vodafone R&D teams in London and in Spain. The beta of the Exchange server was built on top of Ocastalab's Statusnet service and is currently live.

From the Vodafone site: 

> Agora is an open trading platform for individuals and groups to post items and services for sale or exchange. Have an extra laptop lying around? Need a bike instead? No problem... 

With Agora, you can specify what you'd like in exchange (including cash or services) and the system will alert you to others that have what you're looking for. You can make offers, negotiate with others until you secure an agreement, and then leave comments and ratings for your completed deals.

Dug wrote a business case for funding from the Vodafone Social Investment Fund (SIF) and secured funding for pilot launches in Egypt and Romania. Egyptian UI concept (Al Souq) below.

You can download the Android app from Vodafone.
