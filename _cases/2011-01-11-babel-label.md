Dug designed this independent Jazz label's first online shop and 'listening booths' which allowed visitors to stream album content from the website. 

The experience made use of the first reliable, high-quality audio streaming using RealAudio Player[^1], and Apple's Quicktime 3 browser plugin.[^2]

Here's a screengrab from web prehistory, taken from the website in summer 1999 (using Netscape running on an OS8 machine - OS9 came out in October of that year...).

It's interesting to see what has evolved over time and what design patterns from 20 years ago are still relevant today. Below is the label's page (not my design, hosted on Bandcamp) in 2020.

[^1]: Arguably the first to establish a reliable streaming plugin see [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RealPlayer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RealPlayer)
[^2]: At the time Mac users had the better audio quality with Quicktime but the RTSS encode and stream protocol was untested see [https://macintoshgarden.org/apps/quicktime-3](https://macintoshgarden.org/apps/quicktime-3)
