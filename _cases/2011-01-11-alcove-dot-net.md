Alcove was a live beta for a new kind of integrated shopping service. It was built as a magazine that allowed visitor to purchase directly items featured in the editorial. 

The stretch was to mash-up our experience of managing relationships and content in contract publishing with the latest bleeding edge digital tech courtesy of Offworld Industries (a digital agency pushing the boundaries of digital at the time)

Dug designed the launch issue and the shopping interface. The pilot ran for 6 months and generated interest. 

At the time, we didn't know about lean service creation, but in a classic 'test and learn' the pilot exposed challenges around fulfillment and integration, things we take for granted these days as problems that are solved:-)
