![roughing out the interaction concept](/i/bill-fixer-roughs.png)

The insight here was customers were forever getting bills they didn't expect and they didn't like the BT model of having to purchase an extra package to save money. 
In our proposed concept, the bill is visualised in a two-way feedback system which allows the problem to be fixed by dragging the circle with a gesture and the appropriate back-office adjustments (change of package, supplement etc.) happen in the background.
