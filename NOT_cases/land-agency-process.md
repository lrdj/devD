  Service blueprint with "data accuracy" lens
hero_image_caption: >
  Blueprints of the service showing “moments of truth”. These include: Registration for alerts will avoid call-centre interactions; Reduced data errors will avoid triggering notification letters and ensuing support calls. The red-and-green bar at the bottom is the "lens" that shows data accuracy over time.

situation: >
  The project brief was to design a CRM system to make the workforce more efficient and enable the agency to better control the behaviour of land owners.
task: >
  I was contracted as service designer to lead the discovery and design of the new platform. I worked in a team of three with two researchers. 
activity: >
  I interviewed users across the service ecosystem, both inside and outside the agency, using a mix of face-to-face interviews and shadowing. I worked alongside BAs and technology partners to map the problem space, identify opportunities, and clarify the product vision. When sense-making began to point to a problem with the brief, I set up installations in the kitchens of all the agency's offices and gathered broad knowledge and feedback of what was really going on.
result: >
  As a result of the ethnographic intervention TBC

  Over time, it had become a 'portalised' hold-all for elements of tax code communications; PAYE; and pensions information display.</p>
  <p>
  This TBC lack of a clear purpose led the leadership team to kick off a phase of visioning work and I was contracted as an external advisor to lead this exploration and produce recommendations.</p>

![Existing product framework](/i/cases/landregulator/L1-all-notes.png)

<p class="imagecaption">The existing product framework was hampered by the definition of user needs as isolated from the organisation's purpose. As a result, the PTA had grown into a container for content that that user research show there was a need for.</p>

In order to bring together a large and complex network of stakeholders, I created design tools and led teams through a sequence of strategy and design thinking workshops: assumptions mapping; problem space assessment; purpose definition; challenge mapping; and vision canvas[^1]. These workshops resulted in greater clarity and a much simpler purpose statement centred on reducing costs while building citizen trust.

With the vision successfully in place, I expressed the as-is/to-be gaps in a series of service blueprints and wrote the next phase briefing with technical architects, business and delivery teams.




[^1]: I designed the Vision Canvas ([review longer article](https://goodlookslikethis.com/vision-canvas-workshops.html)) as an extension to the standard business model canvas (https://www.strategyzer.com/canvas/business-model-canvas) taking into account the different range of pressures and influences a service experiences in public sector. The canvas introduces a #oneTeamGov approach, planning for inclusion of policy constraints and identifying opportunities to share findings to help other organisations acting in the same ecosystem.
