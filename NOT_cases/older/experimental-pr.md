![The Experimental Pragmatics website](/i/book/exprag_364.png)

In the spirit of releasing early and often, experimentalpragmatics.org went live last night well before the design was actually finished. 

Dug can't pretend to understand the concepts of relevance and utterance interpretation, but he's happy to be able to help another non-profit onto the internet.
