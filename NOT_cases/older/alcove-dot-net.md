situation: >
  I was the product development manager for a small technology company who landed a chance to pitch our flagship product to a major player in our sector.
task: >
  Our CEO asked me to put together a demonstration we could take to the potential client in the hope of clinching the deal.
activity: >
  As I had in-depth technical knowledge of the product, I put together a comprehensive list of the benefits it could bring to the client, and drew up answers to all the potential queries I could think of. Next, I recruited two colleagues into the project. The first colleague took my product notes and worked them into an attractive sales demonstration, while the second used her presentational skills to deliver the pitch. Afterwards all three of us were available to answer questions from the client.
result: >
  The presentation was a success thanks to our combined and complementary skills, and resulted in a trial order from the client.

Alcove was a live beta for a new kind of integrated shopping service. It was built as a magazine that allowed visitor to purchase directly items featured in the editorial. 

The stretch was to mash-up our experience of managing relationships and content in contract publishing with the latest bleeding edge digital tech courtesy of Offworld Industries (a digital agency pushing the boundaries of digital at the time)

Dug designed the launch issue and the shopping interface. The pilot ran for 6 months and generated interest. 

At the time, we didn't know about lean service creation, but in a classic 'test and learn' the pilot exposed challenges around fulfillment and integration, things we take for granted these days as problems that are solved:-)
