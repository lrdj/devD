  Service blueprint with "data accuracy" lens
hero_image_caption: >
  Blueprints of the service showing “moments of truth”. These include: Registration for alerts will avoid call-centre interactions; Reduced data errors will avoid triggering notification letters and ensuing support calls. The red-and-green bar at the bottom is the "lens" that shows data accuracy over time.

situation: >
  Stakeholders were finding it hard to develop a roadmap for a gov.uk service as there was no foundational vision in place.
task: >
  I was contracted as an external advisor to lead a discovery and produce recommendations.
activity: >
  I led teams through a sequence of strategy and design thinking workshops. I brought teams together to co-design their possible futures and working in partnership with policy and delivery stakeholders, I produced documented recommendations.
result: >
  Armed with their new knowledge and planning, stakeholders where able to plan and win budget for the next year's programme of continual improvement.

  <p style="font-size: larger;">
  The HMRC "Personal Tax Account" was suffering from a number of existential challenges. Owners and service managers could not identify exactly what problems the service was designed and built to solve, nor could they pinpoint any specific needs it addressed.</p>

  <p>
  Over time, it had become a 'portalised' hold-all for elements of tax code communications; PAYE; and pensions information display.</p>
  <p>
  This lack of a clear purpose led the leadership team to kick off a phase of visioning work and I was contracted as an external advisor to lead this exploration and produce recommendations.</p>

![Existing product framework](/i/cases/pta/as-is-product.jpeg)
<p class="imagecaption">The existing product framework was hampered by the definition of user needs as isolated from the organisation's purpose. As a result, the PTA had grown into a container for content that that user research show there was a need for.</p>

In order to bring together a large and complex network of stakeholders, I created design tools and led teams through a sequence of strategy and design thinking workshops: assumptions mapping; problem space assessment; purpose definition; challenge mapping; and vision canvas[^1]. These workshops resulted in greater clarity and a much simpler purpose statement centred on reducing costs while building citizen trust.

## Method



![Some slides from the synthesis report](/i/cases/pta/findings-deck.png)


With the vision successfully in place, I expressed the as-is/to-be gaps in a series of service blueprints and wrote the next phase briefing with technical architects, business and delivery teams.




[^1]: I designed the Vision Canvas ([review longer article](https://goodlookslikethis.com/vision-canvas-workshops.html)) as an extension to the standard business model canvas (https://www.strategyzer.com/canvas/business-model-canvas) taking into account the different range of pressures and influences a service experiences in public sector. The canvas introduces a #oneTeamGov approach, planning for inclusion of policy constraints and identifying opportunities to share findings to help other organisations acting in the same ecosystem.
