  Service blueprint with "data accuracy" lens
hero_image_caption: >
  Blueprints of the service showing “moments of truth”. These include: Registration for alerts will avoid call-centre interactions; Reduced data errors will avoid triggering notification letters and ensuing support calls. The red-and-green bar at the bottom is the "lens" that shows data accuracy over time.

situation: >
  Stakeholders were finding it hard to develop a roadmap for a gov.uk service as there was no foundational vision in place.
task: >
  I was contracted as an external advisor to lead a discovery and produce recommendations.
activity: >
  I led teams through a sequence of strategy and design thinking workshops. I brought teams together to co-design their possible futures and working in partnership with policy and delivery stakeholders, I produced documented recommendations.
result: >
  Armed with their new knowledge and planning, stakeholders where able to plan and win budget for the next year's programme of continual improvement.

  <p>
  The NHS screening services for cancers such as breast, cervical and bowell cancer are all supported by one digital organisation, responsible for the digital transformation of those services. Really complex situation - NBSS burning platform - Stakeholder focused on digital - Complex network of vendors</p>

Synthesise the insights enough to allow the customer to make difficult decisions about what to do next
Access to patients restricted because of coronavirus


Understanding the ecosystem constraints
- Unravel the spaghetti: NHS/PHE/others
- Desk research, onboarding with data
- Primary service design research (role-play workshops with SMEs and stakeholders)
- Policy safari, meeting stakeholders across policy, digital and clinical. How the pieces fit together

Understand the patient experience. 
- Learn the patient journey and undertand this journey in the context of a wider preventative medecine context considering the impacts of genetics, culture, economics, education etc.

Understanding the journey across all types of screening (cervical, breast, bowell etc)
- Build a picture of archetypical patients
- Role play these experiences with all stakeholders and SMEs
- Develop an 'extensible' journey that will support a plan to build once and reuse across different screening pathways.

Map out the technology
- Understand the architecture of how patient data is captured, stored, and transfered between devices, buildings, networks and vehicles
- Understand the choices made previously which have set up the tech debt and explore options to think differently about the problem

Sensemaking and evangelism
Facilitate a series of design thinking workshops with product and programme leadership to create a collective understanding of the situation and document the challenges to the digital screening service so that leadership could tell the story and win further funding.

Run ideation with a cross disciplinary team of leaders. Establish the blueprint of the 'extensible service' with an emphasis on identifying the "lego pieces" that could be re-used between silos and stakeholders. 

Facilitate strategy sessions to map out the end-to-end service with all the lego pieces and collectively prioritise the elements. 

Across the multiple screening patient journeys, four strategic themes or areas of focus emerged and I produced a blueprint document showing the elements to focus on in each of the four themes.

Product leadership were then able to build my findings and recommendations into the business case for digital investment. 

My stakeholder was successful in his application and the extensible service "mvp" is in production with further screening journeys going live over the coming months.
