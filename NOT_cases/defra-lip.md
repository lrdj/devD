  <p>
  The LIP programme had been running for a little over two years when I joined the team as Lead Service Designer. While many talented professionals were involved, there was no ‘glue’ holding them together and helping them to grow or ultimately deliver digital outcomes.</p>
  <p>
  In particular, there was little or no understanding of the “diverge/converge” design thinking process, and no guiding roadmap to bring together IT, data, policy and design workstreams. The design team was large and included four user researchers but had no framework with which to usefully frame their insights and develop them into initiatives.</p>

I engaged on multiple levels, acting as trusted advisor to the leadership team, influencing stakeholders as appropriate, training the product team leads, mentoring, coaching, and transfering knowledge to the design team. 

I created and communicated a programme-wide ‘tube map’ to explain to everyone what had to be done. 

First, I guided the team through a strategy phase to agree on the actual problem to solve and the strategic themes to focus on. After that, I guided the teams through a four-phase ‘double-diamond’ design process resulting in the delivery of a series of successful prototypes and an agreed specification for the service MVP.

[^1]: I designed the Vision Canvas ([review longer article](https://goodlookslikethis.com/vision-canvas-workshops.html)) as an extension to the standard business model canvas (https://www.strategyzer.com/canvas/business-model-canvas) taking into account the different range of pressures and influences a service experiences in public sector. The canvas introduces a #oneTeamGov approach, planning for inclusion of policy constraints and identifying opportunities to share findings to help other organisations acting in the same ecosystem.
