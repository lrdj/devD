The biggest challenge of CSAT survey handling is how to create a question/answer flow that allows the customer to describe the problem while ensuring this data is correctly stored and acted on.

I just had a hickup in a shopping experience and filled in Carpetright's CSAT + NPS survey (not sure what <a href="http://www.bain.com/publications/articles/introducing-the-net-promoter-system-loyalty-insights.aspx">Bain</a> would make of that, the mix of the two ways of measuring?).

As usual, the questions are written in such a way as to make it difficult to report the actual problem (poorly orchestrated service components) but luckily the survey included a catch-all text input which I used:

> I love the carpet, it's very clever (suggests sisal at a fraction of the cost and with greater cleaning ability).
>
> But as ever, your NPS survey is structured in a such a way as to prevent the sharing of the actual problem. The issue is one of service design, in other words how all the parts of your service fit together to ensure a satisfied customer.

(I continued...)

The problem with my delivery is I now have two very heavy doors sitting off their hinges in a room upstairs.

The surveyor (who appeared to do a very thorough job) should have flagged this to me (that the lack of underlay would mean a risk that doors might not have enough clearance) so that I could have arranged a chippie on site. Or, the delivery team (two strong men with tools), having already sweated the removal of the doors, could have quite easily trimmed or rasped the clearance off the bottom of the doors.

> Either way, this was not handled well as a service. You need to a) avoid the scenario OR b) brief your installers on the proper handling of similar scenarios.

> I now have to get a carpenter to sort this out at my expense:-(

It's a challenge, the problem might have been caused by the driver's actions (ie straightforwardly incorrect behaviour) or it might have been that the driver did everything by the book but the book didn't include instructions for what to do in a given situation, say what to do about the other driver from a different company delivering at the same time, or how to factor in the rain/snow weather and so on.

How to capture that data in a format that supports making the data actionable?

To borrow from KM systems, the data needs to be seen as accurate and be findable. In the context of CSAT, how does this feedback get played back to the right stakeholders in the business?

I would argue there are some great CRM/CX consultants out there but could it be time for businesses to start sensing the emerging properties caused by the design of their systems? 

I think it is, and this means a requirement for in-house service design:-)
