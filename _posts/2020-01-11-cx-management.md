intro: >
  Off to hear some amazing speakers at Customer Experience Management, Seems like increasingly CX is becoming synonymous with contact centre management, which feels like we're missing a trick (what with the experience being better managed in round, a la service design) but I guess this is how the market is playing out.

Hi, if you're here it might be because you've just had a chat with Dug at <a href="http://www.customerexperienceevent.com/">CEM</a> and pointed your device at the QR on my badge.

Really looking forward to the panel this afternoon. particularly looking forward to hearing from GiffGaff's Claire Kavanagh:-)
