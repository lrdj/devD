  I think it might be worth pulling the problem apart a little bit. What do we mean by wearables?

Well... good question:-)

## Chips and tokens

If I could chip my 13-year-old daughter I possibly would. This would make her body part of the cloud and the chip a sort of wearable.

Same thing applies to other devices that are either permanently online or can trigger a beacon. I backed Tile and [bought a card](https://www.thetileapp.com) and it's pretty cool. I've got a few attached to things I carry around in my laptop bag.

Does that make my presentation clicker a wearable? I guess not but you can see how these things fit into a wider ecosystem of connected stuff related to a given human.

## Worn on the wrist

In terms of actual "wrist" wearables like Apple Watch, I think we have to look at things like Nike Fuel and Fitbit in a different category. 

Apple watch is different, from the moment they first talked about it you could tell they were entering the world of "Haute Horlogerie".

I used to wear a watch made out of Zirconium Oxide with a bullet-proof Sapphire glass. The face was made out of sandwiches of almost radioactive material handled by a team of 35 specialists in Florence and the one I wore was only made in 1000 units.

I recognised this kind of language in the Apple announcement. The use of the word "complication" for example which I'm pretty sure 90% of iPhone buyers had never heard used in the context of a clock, the details of the straps and even the impossibly rare materials priced at "Haute Horlogerie" prices.

I think the Apple Watch is interesting because it is disrupting a market that I'm guessing really didn't see this coming.

That said, Swiss Watch company Mondaine has launched a smart watch (http://www.mondaine.com/files/mondaine_helvetica_no_1_smart_...) which is a traditional automatic mechanism in a traditional steel case but with fitness sensors included and an integration with Android phones. A few others including Tag introduced smart watches at http://www.baselworld.com this year.

I recently backed <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/597507018/pebble-time-awesome-smartwatch-no-compromises">a Kickstarter project</a> called Pebble and am counting the minutes until I get my fabulous steel smartwatch. 

The Pebble is different. It's more focused than the Apple watch and from a user experience point of view is designed from a more holistic, service design perspective. 

For example, the clock face of the Pebble is designed to be used in darkness and light. After all, what's the point of a smartwatch that you can't read in sunlight? Its face isn't a screen but Kindle-like "digital paper" display readable even in bright sunshine. As a result of this approach, the battery life is much much longer than Apple Watch's.

Pebble also introduces a new interaction metaphor. 

Apple Watch has a groovy winder but as far as I can tell, the screen interactions seem very similar to what you're used to on a phone. Pebble on the other hand has re-visited the entire interface to follow a "time" metaphor. Everything you do on the Pebble fits into a timeline concept, where am I now? what is the future? the past etc.

I think these devices all look awesome and I want them now, but the ones I find most satisfying from a design perspective are the ones that explore the areas closest to the human

> so Apple, try a little harder and how about a menstrual cycle calculator in your fitness app? 

No? Oops I forgot, not so many women on the design team looking at the full journey of what we are all trying to achieve every day.
