intro: >
  I was speaking to some consultants recently and we got to talking about empathy and what makes a great ecommerce consultant.

I believe empathy has to be one of the most important qualities of a good consultancy (or indeed of a quality senior manager with a virtual team in a matrix organisation). In some ways it's almost more important than some other core skills in that it's more likely to place the consultant's recommendations firmly under the customer's pain point.

> Multi-channel retailers have questions and need some love and tenderness. 

Ideally, you should feel their pain. They have a bunch of things that keep them up at night and empathising with these will make for a better ecommerce experience consultant. 

## Here's a rough list

_(my favourite nightmares--transcribed unformatted from my moleskine)_

- Do I need analytics, retargeting, algorithmic recommendations, satisfaction survey tools? 
-	Single customer view (oh yes... one of those would be nice)
-	Why does enterprise software cost so ridiculously much? (For the cost of a year's license for entry-level analytics I could hire three engineers?!?)
-	Marketing and communication, how much cash should I be giving Google? How can my trading team and my online marketing team work more closely together?
-	How do traditional insight teams (big database, big budget, slow staging) fit in the same plan as front-end analitics-driven teams (rapid staging, lower cost)?
-	How do I manage the difference in staging speed of different business silos (Experience team leading client-side but with the threat that my front-end is making promises to customer that my back-end can't deliver).

-	Platform issues: Where do I start?!?
    - Performance?
    - Governance?
    - Maintenance?
    - Reliability?
    - (in)flexibility or scalability?
-	What data can I trust? How can I manage my progress?
-	Generally, how to I measure and manage the impact on my customer experience of:
  -	Range extension (marketplace, OEM, etc)
  -	SKU availability (allocation online/offline etc)
  -	Delivery (number of men, suppliers, boxing and packaging issues)
  -	Product information and imagery, access to exciting rich media etc
  -	Selling and fulfilling across the channels (multichannel retail suffering!)
  -	Social content
  -	EPOS disasters, why is it so hard to simply give the customer his pound coin back and why does he have to give his postcode?
  -	Content management, why is it so hard to add, to change content?
-	Times are tough, how do I plan the amortisation of my improvements and "burn rate" for new initiatives?
-	How do I calculate the risk and plan the scheduling of the potential rewards?
-	Call centre costs and governance
-	Uniqueness (satisfying the promise of "unique experiences") - many/most platforms assume SKU interchangability, how do I create unique experiences when ecommerce platforms increasingly follow similar design patterns?
-	Should I be focusing on GETTING THE BASICS RIGHT or do I need to go get some new optimising technology?
-	What? Another javascript tag? Why does every vendor tell me it's easy-peasey to integrate their service, I just need to add a javascript tag? How in heaven's name am I supposed to manage the performance impact?
-	If I can't have bespoke channels, can I have bespoke categories (yes I can!)

So yeah, quite a list:-)

I'm guessing there's a lot more, but even with this rough first draft, I can see some broad areas where a consultant might want to focus attention:

## Start with the "Digital Map"

Where do we need to be in the mid-to-long term and what do we need to get there? Most businesses maintain a voice-of-the-customer report and maintain a "Customer Plan" these days. The Digital Map builds on those learnings and supports those commitments but with a focus on the elements that directly influence ecommerce performance. 

## What can I do today?

While we work on a digital map we also need to think about YoY reporting and getting results as quickly as possible. A lot of the nightmares above can be at least addressed at this stage.

## Making stuff that works better, like a better online store

A lot of the above touch on good old fashioned design and build. The consultant needs to be able to deliver a quantifiably better ecommerce website building on the customer's platform investment.

## Deeper fixes underpinning the online experience

It's unlikely you're going to let me edit the Cobol that structures your mainframe's performance but somewhere between the ubiquitous SAP rollout-that-never-happens and cryogenic defrosting of top programmers active in 1979 there lies a wide scope of systems analysis and solutions analysis and architecture. You're going to want to offer those services too.

## If you can't measure it you can't...

Ecommerce managers are some of the most accountable folk around. 

When your basket is dropping and your MI is a mess its easy to find your bonus under threat. These guys needs top-notch help with people, processes and performance measurement.
So lots to consider when choosing a consultant then:-)
